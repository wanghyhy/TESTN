## TESTN
This is the implementation of the paper "TESTN: A Triad-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Network for Multi-Temporal POI Relationship Inference".

## Datasets
The raw data of different cities can be downloaded as follows:

Tokyo/NYC: https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset

Chicago: https://divvybikes.com/system-data

## Train
Train the model using `python train.py`. We provide the running script for different datasets with specific parameters: `bash run.sh`.

## Acknowledgement
The model architecture of TESTN follows [SEENet](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSpatial/tree/main/research/SEENet).
